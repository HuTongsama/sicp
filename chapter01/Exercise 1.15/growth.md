When (sine a) is evaluated,it's orderof growth in space 
and number of steps used by the process is O(log n).Since
the value a is divided by 3 each time,when the procedure 
evaluates (sine / angle 3.0).If the value a become about 
three times as much as the old value a,the procedure p 
will be applied one more time.
